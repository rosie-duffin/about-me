        <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I began learning to code in October 2020, after a short period of
          soul-searching following my decision to leave the teaching profession.
          I am currently studying towards professional certifications in
          software development. I now have a CIW certification in Advanced
          HTML5/CSSÂ£ and an MTA certification in Introduction to Programming
          Using Python.
